					<h4>About Car some</h4>
					<p>
					Car INSPECTION is an organized examination or formal evaluation exercise. In engineering, inspection involves the measurements, tests, and gages applied to certain characteristics in regard to an object or activity. The results are usually compared to specified requirements and standards for determining whether the item or activity is in line with these targets. Some inspection methods are destructive; however, inspections are usually nondestructive. Nondestructive examination (NDE), or nondestructive testing (NDT), are a number of technologies used to analyze materials for either inherent flaws (such as fractures or cracks), or damage from use. Some common methods are visual, microscopy, liquid or dye penetrant inspection, magnetic particle inspection, eddy current testing, x-ray or radiographic testing, and ultrasonic testing. This chapter provides an overview of the inspection methods that will be covered in the remainder of this book.
